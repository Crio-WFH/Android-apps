# MeetUp

An app to connect with people virtually, *and easily*!

MeetUp allows people to manage all virtual events from within the app. From creating an event to sending events to all atendees to automatically generate Google Meet Links, MeetUp does everything for you.


## Features

- View all your events created on MeetUp.

- Send Google Calendar email invite notification instantly while creating an event for all atendees.

- Create Groups of friends in the app, and add the entire group as atendees for an event.

- Choose to add a Google Meet link automatically to the calendar invites.

- You can also choose to use another app like Zoom, Microsoft Teaams or Skype.

- Never leave MeetUp - Join the event meet directly from MeetUp itself.
